This project is all about setting up a virtual machine with a LINUX OS running on it. There is a bunch of requirements specifying how the VM needed to be set up which i will not detail here because believe, they were a lot. You can find them below in the pdf requirements.

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). 

Once finished, because of the size of the .vdi file of the VM, which was about in between 5-10GB depending on the set up chosen for the VM, the .vdi file which contained the VM data was stored in the campus cloud. The thing is that due to a migration from MACOS to LINUX that was performed in the campus, all my files were erased from my cloud storage in campus. That is why there is no .vdi file uploaded to this repo. 

My bad, should have made a backup.

However, the following snapshot if proof that the project was succesfully done:

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus: [README_B2B.pdf](https://github.com/Alvicina/B2B/files/15310050/README_B2B.pdf)
