This project is all about setting up a virtual machine with a LINUX OS running on it. There is a bunch of requirements specifying how the VM needed to be set up. 

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus: [README_B2B.pdf](https://github.com/Alvicina/B2B/files/15310050/README_B2B.pdf)

The following snapshot if proof that the project was succesfully done:
